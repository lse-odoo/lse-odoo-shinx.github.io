My name is Loan (known internally in Odoo as LSE) and I'm a software engineer. I'm passionate about technology and I love to share my knowledge with others.
I have been working in Odoo since October 2019 as a Software Engineer/Technical Support.

Toward my years in Odoo, I found some interesting elements whether trivia, techniques, or tips that I would like to share with you.

This website does not aim to replace Odoo's official documentation,
but to complement it with some practical explanations that would not have their place their.
